## TODO Fixes:
- [ ] if `","` joins into key array row, then push before a `"\"` and add logic to ignore `"\,"` command
- [ ] fix when random backslash are on the way (test3 isnt working)
- [ ] if worth, zip also the map so to create a `map-of-map` (2d -> 3d -> 4d?...)
- [ ] it is slow, try to create more async chunks
- [ ] write it in python and add the possibility to run that in threads (each thread runs a chunk)
- [ ] more engines (overall-best, json-oriented, ...other usecases)
